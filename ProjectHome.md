Bugzilla has quips, small text messages that can be configured to appear next to search results.  Users submit quips and a random quip is chosen for display on each search.

When we moved from Bugzilla to Jira, we missed our quips.  This plugin brings them back, albeit as a dashboard gadget rather than on the search results.
